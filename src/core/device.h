 - one or more IEC 61499 compliant resources (CResource),
 -  a device management (CDeviceAdministrator)
 -  a function block execution environment (CFBNExecution)
 -  a library (CTypeLib) which administrates the types the 1499 device is
 capable of
 - External event interface for handling interrupts and other external notifications.
 -  FORTE-HAL: FORTE Hardware Abstraction Layer

 There are different device type's available (e.g. remote device RMT_DEV)
 for different tasks which have different device configurations
 (resources function blocks) and device parameters.
